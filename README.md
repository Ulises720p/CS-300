# CS-300

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Throughout the projects in CS-300 the problem I was solving was implementing the different kinds of data structures for a program that reads data from a file and loads them into the respective data structure.
The data structure that I worked on implemting for the project was the Binary search tree DS.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To approach the problem I used the my knowledge of the different data structures that I learned about in this course and chose the data structure that I thought was the most effective to implement and solve the problem. Data structures are important to understand because they dictate how data is organized and accessed within a computer's memory. Choosing the right data structure for a specific task can significantly impact a program's performance in terms of speed and memory usage. Having a in depth nderstanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the different data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash tables, programmers can write more optimized and effective code.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Throughout the activites in this course and even the project I did encounter many roadblocks mostly related to incorrect syntax and incorrect implementation of the different data structures. To overcome these roadblocks i relied heavily on the visual studio debugger which was really helpful in identifying the syntax errors as well as the logical errors. Aside from the debugger I had myself constantly looking back at the learning material especially the zybook to remind myslef of how to correctly implement the different data structures.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project and the activities has significantly expanded my skills in software design by emphasizing the importance of comparing the different data structures and algorithms to use to solve a specific problem. 
By comparing the different data structures and algorithms I can select which apprach would be the most efficient to solve the problem.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Working on this project improved my ability to write maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. At first I prioritized on getting the functionality of the code to work over quality of my code, this led my code being difficult to modify afterwards. The project's requirments made me to adopt better practices like formatting, meaningful names, balanced comments, and modular design. Overall I feel like this project and the other activites have helped me expand my skills in software design.
